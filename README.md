## UI

### Xcode and Interface Builder

Xcode is an application used to write apps for various Apple platforms. Interface Builder is a tool within Xcode which allows users to develop portions of an app visually, without having to write code.

### UIKit

UIKit is a framework provided by Apple to aid in the development of an app's user interface. UIKit has all the basic components to build just about any UI/UX you can dream up.  Understanding the basic building blocks of UIKit and their default behavior is essential to understanding which parts of your design are possible without having to develop a custom component. Having an understanding of UIKit components and their intended behavior, along with knowledge of Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, can help you design a beautiful, native UI. You can think of UIKit as a designer/developer's LEGO kit for app development.
